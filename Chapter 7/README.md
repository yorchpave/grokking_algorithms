# Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Breadth-first search is used to calculate the shortest path for an unweighted graph.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path for a weighted graph.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm works when all the weights are positive.
- If you have negative weights, use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
